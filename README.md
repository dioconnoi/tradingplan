## Trading Setup

### MARKET ANALYSIS - Fundamental Analysis

DO NOT trade forex during the hour before and after medium and high priority economic data, policymaker speeches and news releases relevant to either currency in a currency pair.

### MARKET ANALYSIS - Technical Analysis 

- Trading System: Bullish/Bearish Pin Bar Reversal Candlestick (Kangaroo Tail)


![Pin Bar](https://forextraininggroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Pin-Bar-Structure.png)


### Validity Pin Bar:
- The long wick should be at least 2-3 times the length of the body of the candlestick
- The body should be larger than previous bars range
- The body should be present towards either the upper or lower extreme of the Pin Bar
- The wick should stand out when compared to previous bars (with room to the left)
- Pin Bar will affect immediately following 4-5 bars
- Pin Bar should print at a Support and Resistance:
 * Candle rejection: The wick touches the support/resistance but the body don't
 * Ideally at the end of an impulsive move and may indicate the beginning of a reversal price momentum
- Pin Bar that appear/close in direction of the Trend
 * IF UPTREND then BULLISH Pin Bar closes higher than than the open.
 * IF DOWNTREND then BEARISH Pin Bar closes lower than the open.

- Avoir Pin Bar that doesn't show a price rejection evidence

### Identify Market Trend: 

- Switch to WEEKLY Chart: Draw Trendlines only touching at least 2 wicks (parallel)

- Switch to DAILY LINE CHART: Draw  Major & Minor (INTRA) Support & Resistance Zones

 * IF current Price > 200 EMA THEN UPTREND. => Look for a BUY
 * IF current Price < 200 EMA THEN DOWNTREND => Look for a SELL

 look for DOUBLE BOTTOM : MAJOR SUPPORT + MAJOR SUPPORT TRENDLINE
 look for DOUBLE TOP: MAJOR RESISTANCE + MAJOR RESISTANCE TRENDLINE
 
 ALWAYS TRADE NEAR AN AREA OF SUPPORT / RESISTANCE
 
### Trend Status: 
- Beginning
- Ongoing
- Ending

 
### CONTINUATION PATTERN: 
- Ignore PinBar formed against the current trend
- Ignore PinBar at least 4 times larger than previous candlesticks range

## Indicators Used for Confluence (Focus on QUALITY SETUPS)
Factors of Confluence:
- The Trend
- Support/Resistance Level, Supply & Demand Zones
- Moving Averages
- Fibonacci Retracements (Based on Top and Bottom of most recent TREND)
- Trendlines: After drawing it , wait for price to retrace back to it
- Bolinger Bands : If price are rejected (PinBar) from the major levels and from the Bands it is a confirmation
- Large Round Numbers: Pay attention to large round numbers closed to a Pin Bar (historically)
- Pivot Points (PP): 
- Check Swissquote PinBar Indicator visual (if any)

Moving Averages are used to gauge the direction and strength of the trend - They are dynamic SR Levels. price religiously bounces off certain EMAs during retraces.

- SMA(8, 21, 89)
- EMA(50, 200) - reacts more quickly to recent price events than SMA
- Fibonacci Retracement: 38.2, 50 and 61.8 are the most important levels for Pin Bar. Trade it in confluence with MA and EMA.
- Pivot Points
- Stochastic (Correlated to SUPPORT/RESISTANCE) DAILY Chart: 
  * WE TRADE between (0 - 20) - OVERBOUGHT Market (near RESISTANCE)
  * WE TRADE between (80 - 100) - OVERSOLD Market (near SUPPORT)
  * Otherwise WE DONT TRADE

### CONFLUENCE Examples: 
- Strong UpTrend + PullBack to 21EMA + Fib 50% Level + Pin Bar 
- Strong UpTrend + PullBack to 21EMA + S&R level + Bullish Pin Bar
- UpTrend + PullBack to 50EMA + Fibo 50% Level + S&R Level + Pin Bar
- DownTrend + PullBack to 50EMA + Fibo 50% Level + S&R Level + Pin Bar
- DownTrend + Pullback to Pivot + Fibo 78.6% Level + Pin Bar


## Timeframes

- 4H
- Daily

## Entry Signal (On PULLBACK ONLY - WAIT FOR IT !!!!)

!!! DO NOT ENTER 'MARKET EXECUTION' ORDERS !!!!

!!! DO NOT ENTER TRADES FROM MOBILE DURING THE DAY !!!!

### External conditions to consider (market or news events):
  * check https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-economic-calendar  - if any RED flag (imapcting news) about the pair - DO NOT TRADE
  
### Method1: Aggressive Entry Option: 
- Immediately after the Pin Bar closes, without waiting for a confirmation - we catch move at the beginning based on :
   * The Trend: UPTREND / DOWNTREND
   * Pin Bar formed at a Support / Resistance Level
   * Pin Bar formed after a retracement
   
### Method2: Enter ON STOP - Entry Option:
- STOP Order1: Place BUY/SELL STOP ORDER a small distance (2-3 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (knowing that the price has moved in the direction of profit before placing the trade).
- STOP Order2: Place SELL/BUY STOP ORDER a small distance (2-3 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (in case of reversal)
- Delete STOP order that is not triggered after price movement (Immediately)

### Method3: 50% Pin Bar Retrace - Conservative Entry Option: 
- Enter after 50% of  the range bar retracement - We decrease our risk and increase our reward (there is a Risk of missing the ENTRY)
- BUY/SELL LIMIT ORDER at 50% Pin Bar Retracement (May miss some ENTRY opportunities if price don't retrace)


### Money Management - Conditions to enter (REASONS NOT to TRADE): 
   * Enter on open of next bar after current pin bar
   * Check daily, weekly, monthly drawdown => lot size calculation (generate SL, TP1,TP2 and TP3)
   * Risk 3% of account balance per trade
   * Minimum Risk/Reward ration 1:3 or greater
   * ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE PREVIOUS DAILY CANDLE TO CLOSE
- Add new trade to journal : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYp9zuLJZ5bxZBdvmD7DJhnc7vrzpv3G?ogsrc=32 
- Take a screenshot of the trade at market CLOSE (BEFORE) in Trello: https://trello.com/b/Jj6QDSv2/trading-journal-2018





## Trade Management 

Upon +10 pips in profit => Move STOP LOSS to breakeven and repeat it every 20 pips

## STOP LOSS
Place a stop to cover your bases in case my predictions about where the price will go is completely wrong.  

### Method1: At 50% of Pin Bar Range
### Method2: 2-3 pips Beyond Pin Bar High/Low (Check impact on lot size, may need to reduce it)

Once the trade moves 2 or more pips in my favour bring my STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN

## POSITION SIZE (Trade Size !!!!) - 

Take the appropriate risk for the trade (Not too High, Not too Low). This is the number of lots (micro, mini or standard)

- Account Risk (Account risk limit per trade): 10% weekly,  

- Trade Risk: 3% per trade (Max 6 Daily trades). - Pips at risk on each trade:difference between ENTRY and STOP LOSS

SL is 30 pips

$ at risk = Pips at risk X Pips Value X Lots traded.     => Lots Traded = $ at risk / (Pips at risk X Pips Value)

Example: 
- Account size : $1k  ( account in USD)
- Pips at risk on trade: $30(3%)   
- Pips value = 25 pips SL 
Pair: EURUSD

Lot traded = $30/(25 x $1) = 1.2   => Take:
- 1 trade with lot 1.2 
- 3 trades with 0.4 lot size each

## TAKE PROFIT
The most important thing to do as a trader. Not every trade is a winner. 
### Method1. TP at nearest Support/resistance zone inside previous bar range (Low Risk) - (FAKE, easily broken. too early)
### Method2. TP at previous bars LOW or HIGH (Medium Risk, risk reward ration: should be minimum 1:1.5)
### Method3. TP at nearest insterest level outside previous bar range 
### Method4. Parabolic SAR: Hold Trade in Profit until the DOT of the Parabolic SAR appear in the reverse direction of the current trend

## PARTIAL PROFIT:
- Take 50% of profit at TP1
- Take 75 - 100% profit at TP2 or TP3 (Only do this after moving STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN)

## Trailing STOP LOSS



## EXIT Signal

- Zone Exit (hit profit target or stop loss or breakeven).
- 3-Bar Exit
- Trailing Stop Loss (stop loss to breakeven, Lock in profit to leave trade unattended)
- Take a screenshot of the trade (AFTER) in Trello: https://trello.com/b/Jj6QDSv2/trading-journal-2018
- Update trade in Journal (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYp9zuLJZ5bxZBdvmD7DJhnc7vrzpv3G?ogsrc=32)
