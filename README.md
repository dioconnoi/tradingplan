### TECHNICAL MARKET ANALYSIS  - Where to place Entries,Stop Losses, Take Profits.

Attempt to identify FUTURE PRICE movces by evaluating price charts. This involve studying patterns on the charts which indicate possible future price direction: 

- Price Action on chart
- Support Resistance
- Fibonacci Tools
- Technical Indicators (MAs, Parabolic SAR, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, RSI,etc..)


### Questions
- Can I identify the main themes that drove the markets yesterday?
- Are there any clear identifiable strong and weak currencies at present?
- Will my trade ideas be pairing a STRONG currency with a WEAK currency?
- What type of important economic data is coming up that I should be aware of?
- Does my technical analysis give me a suitable entry location?
- Am I sure the sentiment in the market is enough to move price in my direction?


### Identify Market Trend: 

- Switch to WEEKLY Chart: Draw Trendlines only touching at least 2 wicks (parallel)

- Switch to DAILY LINE CHART: Draw  Major & Minor (INTRA) Support & Resistance Zones

 * IF current Price > 200 EMA THEN UPTREND. => Look for a BUY (The Trend is MY Friend!!!!!)
 * IF current Price < 200 EMA THEN DOWNTREND => Look for a SELL (Don't Trade against the trend)

 look for DOUBLE BOTTOM : MAJOR SUPPORT + MAJOR SUPPORT TRENDLINE
 look for DOUBLE TOP: MAJOR RESISTANCE + MAJOR RESISTANCE TRENDLINE
 
 ALWAYS TRADE NEAR AN AREA OF SUPPORT / RESISTANCE
 
### Identify Current Trend Status: 
- Beginning
- Ongoing
- Ending





## 2. EXECUTE A TRADE 

### POSITION SIZE (Trade Size !!!!) - 

Take the appropriate risk for the trade (Not too High, Not too Low). This is the number of lots (micro, mini or standard)

- Account Risk (Account risk limit per trade): 10% weekly,  

- Trade Risk: 3% per trade (Max 6 Daily trades). - Pips at risk on each trade:difference between ENTRY and STOP LOSS

SL is 30 pips

$ at risk = Pips at risk X Pips Value X Lots traded.     => Lots Traded = $ at risk / (Pips at risk X Pips Value)

Example: 
- Account size : $1k  ( account in USD)
- Pips at risk on trade: $30(3%)   
- Pips value = 25 pips SL 
Pair: EURUSD

Lot traded = $30/(25 x $1) = 1.2   => Take:
- 1 trade with lot 1.2 
- 3 trades with 0.4 lot size each

USE : https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-calculators/position-size 

   * Check daily, weekly, monthly drawdown => lot size calculation (generate SL, TP1,TP2 and TP3)
   * Risk 3% of account balance per trade
   * Minimum Risk/Reward ration 1:3 or greater
   * ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE PREVIOUS DAILY CANDLE TO CLOSE

### Money Management - (REASONS NOT to TRADE): 
   
  
- Add new trade to journal : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYp9zuLJZ5bxZBdvmD7DJhnc7vrzpv3G?ogsrc=32 
- Video record my trading decision process and review it after.
- Take a screenshot of the trade at market CLOSE (BEFORE) in Trello: https://trello.com/b/Jj6QDSv2/trading-journal-2018




## 3. MANAGE A TRADE (Preservation of Capital)

Upon +10 pips in profit => 
- Move STOP LOSS to breakeven and repeat it every 20 pips
- Enter another trade with bigger lot size (To increase PROFIT)

Upon STOP LOSS =>
- Close trade (To reduce LOSSES)



### TAKE PROFIT
The most important thing to do as a trader. Not every trade is a winner. 
#### Method1. TP at nearest Support/resistance zone inside previous bar range (Low Risk) - (FAKE, easily broken. too early)
#### Method2. TP at previous bars LOW or HIGH (Medium Risk, risk reward ration: should be minimum 1:1.5)
#### Method3. TP at nearest insterest level outside previous bar range 
#### Method4. Parabolic SAR: Hold Trade in Profit until the DOT of the Parabolic SAR appear in the reverse direction of the current trend

### PARTIAL PROFIT:
- Take 50% of profit at TP1
- Take 75 - 100% profit at TP2 or TP3 (Only do this after moving STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN)

### Trailing STOP LOSS



### EXIT Signal

- Zone Exit (hit profit target or stop loss or breakeven).
- 3-Bar Exit
- Trailing Stop Loss (stop loss to breakeven, Lock in profit to leave trade unattended)
- Take a screenshot of the trade (AFTER) in Trello: https://trello.com/b/Jj6QDSv2/trading-journal-2018
- Update trade in Journal (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYp9zuLJZ5bxZBdvmD7DJhnc7vrzpv3G?ogsrc=32)


### EXIT IF
