- Pin Bar will affect immediately following 4-5 bars

- Market Trend

- Trend Lines: Gauge trend direction, when a trend have exhausted itself and is about to turn the other way. Pin Bar may form during retracement. BEST Pin Bar to trade because they have lot of SPACE around them.
- Support/Resistance Zone

CONTINUATION PATTERN: If the wick of the Pin Bar is more than 4 times larger than the average trading range of the previous bars.

MA - used to gauge the direction and strength of the trend - They are dynamic SR Levels. price religiously bounces off certain EMAs during retraces.

- SMA(8)
- EMA(21, 50, 200) - reacts more quickly to recent price events than SMA
- Fibonacci Retracement: 38.2, 50 and 61.8 are the most important levels for Pin Bar. Trade it in confluence with MA and EMA.

- 3. TP at nearest insterest level outside previous bar range 

Partial Profit:
