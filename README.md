## Trading Setup

### MARKET ANALYSIS - Fundamental Analysis

DO NOT trade forex during the hour before and after medium and high priority economic data, policymaker speeches and news releases relevant to either currency in a currency pair.

### MARKET ANALYSIS - Technical Analysis 

- Trading System: Bullish/Bearish Pin Bar Reversal Candlestick (Kangaroo Tail)


![Pin Bar](https://forextraininggroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Pin-Bar-Structure.png)


### Anatomy of VALID Pin Bar:
- The long wick should be at least 2-3 times the length of the body of the candlestick
- The body should be completely within previous bars range
- The body should be present towards either the upper or lower extreme of the Pin Bar
- The wick should stand out when compared to previous bars (with room to the left)
- Pin Bar will affect immediately following 4-5 bars
- Pin Bar should print at a Support and Resistance (Candle rejection: The wick touches the support/resistance but the body don't) ideally at the end of an impulsive move and may indicate the beginning of a reversal price momentum
- Pin Bar that appear in direction of the Trend
- Avoir Pin Bar that doesn't show a price rejection evidence

### Identify Market Trend: 

Switch to LINE CHART instead of candlestick to draw Support & Resistance Zone
To Gauge strength and direction of a trend, when a trend have exhausted itself and is about to turn the other way.
We rely on a combination of:

- Trend Lines (DRAW TRENDLINE ON WEEKLY TIMEFRAME, ONLY TOUCHING AT LEAST 2 wicks) - MORE POWERFUL TRENDLINES (Reversals)
- Moving Averages
- Support/Resistance Zone (DRAW MAJOR SUPPORT , MAJOR RESISTANCE and INTRA S&R on the DAILY CHART first)
- Large Round Numbers


IF Price > 200EMA THEN UPTREND.
IF Price < 200EMA THEN DOWNTREND

The BEST Pin Bar to trade  form during retracement at those areas of interest after a sustained move.

- Ideally a Pin Bar should close in the direction of the prevailing trend:
 * IF UPTREND then BULLISH Pin Bar closes higher than than the open.
 * IF DOWNTREND then BEARISH Pin Bar closes lower than the open.
 
 look for DOUBLE BOTTOM : MAJOR SUPPORT + MAJOR SUPPORT TRENDLINE
 look for DOUBLE TOP: MAJOR RESISTANCE + MAJOR RESISTANCE TRENDLINE
 
 ALWAYS TRADE NEAR AN AREA OF SUPPORT / RESISTANCE
 
### Trend Status: 
- Beginning
- Ongoing
- Ending

 
### CONTINUATION PATTERN: 
If the wick of the Pin Bar is more than 4 times larger than the average trading range of the previous bars.
Always trade with the trend.

## Indicators Used for Confluence ONLY
MA - used to gauge the direction and strength of the trend - They are dynamic SR Levels. price religiously bounces off certain EMAs during retraces.

- SMA(8)
- EMA(21, 50, 200) - reacts more quickly to recent price events than SMA
- Fibonacci Retracement: 38.2, 50 and 61.8 are the most important levels for Pin Bar. Trade it in confluence with MA and EMA.
- Pivot Points
- Stochastic (Correlated to SUPPORT/RESISTANCE) DAILY Chart: 
  * WE TRADE between (0 - 20) - OVERBOUGHT Market (near RESISTANCE)
  * WE TRADE between (80 - 100) - OVERSOLD Market (near SUPPORT)
  * Otherwise WE DONT TRADE

CONFLUENCE Examples: 
- Strong UpTrend + PullBack to 21EMA + Fib 50% Level + Pin Bar 
- Strong UpTrend + PullBack to 21EMA + S&R level + Bullish Pin Bar
- UpTrend + PullBack to 50EMA + Fibo 50% Level + S&R Level + Pin Bar
- DownTrend + PullBack to 50EMA + Fibo 50% Level + S&R Level + Pin Bar
- DownTrend + Pullback to Pivot + Fibo 78.6% Level + Pin Bar


## Timeframes

- 1H
- 4H
- D1

## Entry Signal (On PULLBACK ONLY - WAIT FOR IT !!!!)

- External conditions to consider (market or news events):
  * check https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-economic-calendar  - if any RED flag (imapcting news) about the pair - DO NOT TRADE
  
### Money Management - Conditions to enter (REASONS NOT to TRADE): 
   * Enter on open of next bar after current pin bar
   * Check daily, weekly, monthly drawdown => lot size calculation (generate SL, TP1,TP2 and TP3)
   * Risk 2% per trade
   * Minimum Risk/Reward ration 3:1
   * ALWAYS WAIT FOR THE PREVIOUS DAILY CANDLE TO CLOSE
- Add new trade to journal : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYp9zuLJZ5bxZBdvmD7DJhnc7vrzpv3G?ogsrc=32 
- Take a screenshot of the trade at market CLOSE (BEFORE) in Trello: https://trello.com/b/Jj6QDSv2/trading-journal-2018

- Check Swissquote PinBar Indicator visual (if any)

- Order1: Place BUY/SELL STOP ORDER a small distance (2-3 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (knowing that the price has moved in the direction of profit before placing the trade).
- Order2: Place SELL/BUY STOP ORDER a small distance (5 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (in case of reversal)

- Delete order that is not triggered after price movement (Immediately)

## Trade Management 

Upon +10 pips in profit => Move STOP LOSS to breakeven and repeat it every 20 pips

## Stop Loss
Place a stop to cover your bases in case my predictions about where the price will go is completely wrong.  

5 pips below/above Pin Bar - Risk 2% per trade

- STOP LOSS 15 - 20 pips below/above the previous lowest/highest level reached by previous candlesticks   
- Once the trade moves 2 or more pips in my favour bring my STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN

## Position Size (Trade Size !!!!) - 

Take the appropriate risk for the trade (Not too High, Not too Low). This is the number of lots (micro, mini or standard)

- Account Risk (Account risk limit per trade): 10% weekly,  

- Trade Risk: 2% per trade (Max 6 Daily trades). - Pips at risk on each trade:difference between ENTRY and STOP LOSS

SL is 30 pips

$ at risk = Pips at risk X Pips Value X Lots traded.     => Lots Traded = $ at risk / (Pips at risk X Pips Value)

Example: 
- Account size : $1k  ( account in USD)
- Pips at risk on trade: $30(3%)   
- Pips value = 25 pips SL 
Pair: EURUSD

Lot traded = $30/(25 x $1) = 1.2   => Take:
- 1 trade with lot 1.2 
- 3 trades with 0.4 lot size each

## Take Profit
The most important thing to do as a trader.
Not every trade is a winner. 
- 1. TP at nearest (FAKE, easily broken - 4H CHART) support/resistance zone inside previous bar range (Low Risk) - DRAW it GREEN
- 2. TP at previous bars LOW or HIGH (Medium Risk, risk reward ration: 1:1.5)
- 3. TP at nearest insterest level outside previous bar range 
- 4. Parabolic SAR (DAILY CHART): Hold Trade in Profit until the DOT of the Parabolic SAR appear in the reverse direction of the current trend
Partial Profit:
- 50% at TP1
- 75 - 100% profit at TP2 or TP3 (Only do this after moving STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN)

Trailing STOP LOSS
Lock in profit to leave trade unattended.


## Exit Signal

- Zone Exit (hit profit target or stop loss or breakeven).
